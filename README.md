# small-python-projects

I am a beginner Python developer interested in creating as many things as I can. This repository will contain all (or almost all)
the scripts I create in Python.

Some of them will have some use, some of them will be just simple code with no use. Of course, for now, since I'm still a
beginner, the code won't be incredible and definetelly not useful to someone.

I try my best to write clean code, so the people who need to read code can understand how certain things work. I also try to
write comments so people with little experience in Python understand what certain things do, or how the code works.

Feedback from other people is appreciated!
